          <p class="about-me-text">My name is Vitor Gonçalves Rodrigues, I was born in Rio de Janeiro on May 2, 1982, I
            live in Ribeirão Preto in the state of São Paulo.
            I'm a developer and game designer. A little over 2 years ago I decided to migrate to digital
            art. I worked in a startup that has an e-commerce project for 9 months. Today I work on game projects as a
            freelance,
            one of them is a game called Kami Kaido for a studio located in Porto - Portugal. Also I'm creating and
            selling assets on the
            Unity Assets Store. I am passionate about what I do, so much so that I consider it a hobby rather than a
            job..</p>

                  <p>I've been developing with C Sharp for just over 1 year. However, the longest time was within Unity.
                    But I have small projects on GitHub where I used this tool. And of course, every day I learn more
                    because my studies with C Sharp don't stop.</p>

                  <p>Adobe photoshop is used to create digital art. The version I'm currently working on is 2019. All
                    the art I created in my projects was 97% through Photoshop. As I said about myself, I migrated about
                    2 years ago to digital art. Because I spent my whole life drawing and painting in a conventional
                    way.</p>

                    I've been studying CSS since September 2020. And along with the other technologies, I created some
                    projects that are on my GitHub, and I also used them at Big2be.</p>

                    Magus Pocus. Unity is a development engine that uses the C Sharp programming language, more common
                    to
                    create 2D and 3D games, but, as far as I know there are professionals who work with this tool also
                    to
